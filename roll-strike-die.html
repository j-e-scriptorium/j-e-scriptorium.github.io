            <p>The cover illustration is a composite of Pieter Bruegel the Elder's <i>The Beekeepers and the Birdnester</i>, Piet Mondrian's <i>Dune III</i>, and an anonymous drawing from a medieval manuscript.</p>
	    <p>This title of <i>Same Flowers, Same Bees</i> alludes to a poem by Charles Wright. The illustration is Odilon Redon’s <i>Two Young Girls among Flowers</i>.</p>
	    <p>“The Abduction of Kore” is for MCS.</p>
	    <p>“Go to the Bee” adapts passages from <i>Proverbs</i>, the <i>Aeneid</i>, and Pius XII’s Address to Beekeepers.</p>
	    <p>“Bees Bow Down” owes its title to a suggestion from Nicholas.</p>
	    <p>“Platonic Drone” is for ELS, and adopts passages and arguments from the <i>Phaedo</i>.</p>
	    <p>The title of <i>This Twittering World</i> alludes to a poem by T.&nbsp;S. Eliot. The illustration is Paul Klee’s <i>Twittering Machine</i>.</p>
	    <p>The final stanza of the second part of “November Twenty Sixteen” quotes from the Harvard Sentences.</p>
	    <p>“Damasked Eliezer Addresses the Basilisk and Other Demons” imagines internet rationalist and LessWrong founder Eliezer Yudkowsky’s argument against the Roko’s Basilisk thought experiment.</p>
	    <p>“The Economist Visits Damasked Eliezer’s Workshop” dramatizes the AI-Foom Debate that took place between Eliezer Yudkowsky and economist Robin Hanson.</p>
	    <p>“Breed Havoc (The Dervish Runs Out of Steam)” was loosely inspired by the accelerationist philosopher Nick Land, and rearranges the words of Matthew Arnold’s “Dover Beach.”</p>
	    <p>“Summer Solstice, 2020” dramatizes psychiatrist and blogger Scott Alexander’s farewell message on his long-time website SlateStarCodex.</p>
	    <p>Two of “Three Rood Screens” consist of ekphrases upon videos posted to Twitter.</p>
	    <p>The illustration accompanying <i>Salt Spray Gets in Your Eyes</i> is Plate #4 from David Jones’s <i>Ancient Mariner </i> engravings.</p>
	    <p>“Aspidochelone” benefited from the critical comments of R. Cam.</p>
	    <p>Many of the sonnets in this part were spurred on by competition from Alec and Jane, and benefited from their comments during the writing process.</p>
	    <p>“Roll, Strike, Die” is for SMS. It includes a versification of the rules to Str!ke Dice.</p>

                <h5 class="subsection-heading">II. The Pyre</h5>
                
                <p>Abandoned by the departed master, dogged by dreams of the calm with which he went into the numb chill of death's demesne, his students began to philosophize, singing this threnodic melody:</p>

                <div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An economy of life and death</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps circulating each soul's breath;</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She passes into death from life</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into life from where but death?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born already recollecting</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideal artifice, perfecting</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaos, from whence but preexisting</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could come the <i>res</i> of her collecting?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul bears an affinity</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To God, the One, Eternity;</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could she share the corpse's decay</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who owns such high affinity?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In realms of death she lingers long,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learns by heart the ideal song</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes too well, the everything</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That keeps her safe from things so long.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Principles of economy bear, of course, no relation to psychodynamics, nor would the soul's antiquity tell where or how she found her way to prior knowledge. The soul earns from her resemblance to Soul about as much freedom from material necessity as does the body from partaking of ideal Body.</p>

                <p>Still the harmony of his whorling words haunted them, and they sought with these well-reasoned charms to ward off the hobgoblin who gazed so longingly at them from the stony shadows:</p>

                <div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proportion cannot bind</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together all her portions,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ratio presupposes</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship proposed;</p>
                </div>

                <div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does the soul offcast</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body's tattered coat</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only itself to croak</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dry's the last meadcask;</p>
                </div>
<div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intoxicated soul</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is by mortal earth appalled</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sheds it as a caul</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the crystalline and cold.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Heard arguments are sweet, but arguments unheard are sweeter, seeping into the rifts between the combs of intuition, fermenting the accretions of implicit reasoning. This much flows clear: he was the music while the music lasted, and each of them became the music's children.</p>

                <p>When the tocsin tolls, its echoing alarms even those who lift their weight upon its golden cord, so difficult they find the finding in these articulations, in these separated members, of true extensions of any of their selves:</p>

                <div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point to thy flesh</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And call it this;</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy tooled flesh</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appointed this.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think how thy soul</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from thee flows;</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oversoul</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee overflows.</p>
                </div>

                <p>However ostensibly helpful are such melodies in attuning animated flesh, the certain feeling they evoke cannot finally erase the complexities of life's so many faces. To wander singing the unmeaning of each thing save one thrice-great thing, is one thing; to misle of its trace of homecoming one single precious lonely other thing, indeed, is quite another.</p>

                <p>Whether by insight analogic; or allegoric, anagogic, or ironic; finally: afraid of sudden death, suddenly the will moves forth. In height of power, in depth of wit, in length of duration, in breadth of communion, all driven by their uttermost extension and unison into one little word, as is this word:</p>

                <div class="poem">
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R</p>
                </div>

                <p>And this extravagant invocation stirs even the most imperious air. But. If I artlessly imagine that, in sounding this motif, I erode forever the aloof ire of our quite terribly self-irenic God; If I arrogate to myself a passive power to recycle what this one, or is it one too many? breaths have sweetly measured here of death and life; I argue both too much and not enough: I err.</p>

                <p>Four or five men stand before a smoke-filled abyss, framed on either side by intricate stonework and engraved wooden doors flung wide open. They wear on their heads rounded helmets of dull metal, on their bodies surcoats of black with reflective golden stripes and three words emblazoned in the same gold across the upper back: SAPEURS POMPIERS PARIS. Another man, his back to you, walks purposefully towards them. He wears the same metal helmet but a different-colored uniform, golden bars and golden words now on a field of fire-engine red.</p>

                <p>As he steps forward the camera pans up, and you see just above their heads a shining cross, apparently suspended mid-air perhaps a hundred yards off through the open doorway. Sparks slowly cascade from above like a purgatorial veil drawn between them and it. You hear a terrible buzzing, as if from a fan cooling an overheated engine. Sudden flashes of orange and red, perhaps a dozen per second, illuminate the wooden doors and stone pillars in garish color, allowing only brief moments of a more natural, quiet, shadowy blue. The head and shoulders of another helmeted and black-clothed man enter on the right, and he too walks towards the group standing between the doors. As the man in red draws near two of the group turn around to look at him, perhaps to greet him, their faces a pasty white against the abyss behind them, and he takes up a position on the right edge of the doorway. The second newcomer, a few paces behind dead center, reaches up to adjust his helmet.</p>

                <p>Suddenly a sound like thunder interrupts the mechanical hum. The red-clad man turns abruptly around, and looks as if straight into your eyes. The camera pans down and cuts out, the last thing you see a glittering shower of what looks like water droplets. They are lit by the red and orange flashing lights, and seem only a few feet away. The clip is over. Seven seconds have passed. It does not loop.</p>

                <h5 class="subsection-heading">II. Strobes</h5>

                </blockquote>

                <p>Two years earlier. You are in a room, perhaps thirty feet wide, the size of a large classroom or small assembly hall, with a simple gabled ceiling rising from eight feet at the windows to fifteen feet over the central aisle. A priest in embroidered gold vestments bends before a makeshift altar, his back towards you; at his left, kneeling on the maroon carpet, a dark black boy in white alb over black cassock. An altar rail interposes between you and them.</p>

                <p>Surrounding the altar stand a host of tacky ceramic or plastic statues, ranging between two and six feet tall, arranged seemingly at random. To the right of the altar, a miniature pieta on a wooden display table; to the right of that, a haloed woman holding a bunch of roses, perhaps Thérèse of Lisieux; above her, a smaller male figure in blue and red. To the altar's left, three small saints directly on the ground, none reaching higher than belt-level; then a gory crucifixion, somewhat less than life-size; then a benedicting Christ with red and blue rays emanating from his heart; then a slightly smaller white-clad madonna. On a platform behind the altar, a seated Christ with astonishingly white skin. A golden crown and brown hair seem part of the original statue; a garish purple robe seems an added piece of drapery.</p>

                <p>But these are not what you first notice. The space behind the altar has become the canvas for a play of glowing neons: on the right, a slow progression through the spectrum; on the left, quick pulsations of magenta, cyan, yellow, red, green, blue. The colors soak into the plain white curtain hanging behind the seated Christ, but also into the white ceiling and the gigantic posters pasted upon it. These depict religious scenes in a pulp-fiction-cover hyperbole. The most visible, perhaps six feet by six feet, has the crucified Christ, with Blessed Virgin to the left and Father and Holy Ghost hovering above, captioned IT IS FINISHED. Another ceiling poster, further from the light, shows four Hebrew characters beneath the title THE TETRAGRAMMATON.</p>

                <p>As the lights strobe the priest kneels down—you see his head; he too is black—and then, slowly, he stands, elevating the Host above his head, to where it can soak in the psychedelic lights. The altar server lifts the tail of his fiddleback chasuble. Bells ring, then hesitate, then ring again, as he slowly lowers the Host; then silence, as he prepares to genuflect. Thirty-two seconds have passed. The video loops; the priest kneels down again.</p>

                <p>Sunday morning, three years later. You sit in your living room alone, an inessential worker. In a light-drenched church ten states and three seconds away a priest mutters a lorica, preparing for transubstantiation. Between him and you flutters the most subtle of veils, intricately poised between a host of coiled engravings, an electromagnetic rood screen.</p>

MASS WILL BEGIN SHORTLY.</p>

                <p>On the street without, a calm to convince the unguarded that the whole city was at prayer. The next month the fires will begin.</p>

The ship began to rot, from person to place to thing, until at last it was only an idea. Then again the children of the children of the youth found themselves trapped in the shadow of its bleached ribs, now a mass of scaffolding in the high temple of the muse, and no sign of the beloved's clew.</p>
