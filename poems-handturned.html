          <h2 class="chapter-heading"><a href="#postscript">Postscript</a></h2>
          <div class="prose">
            <p>I must state at the outset, emphatically, that I did not write the poem you have just read. I profess neither race mythology nor race science; I am a humble scholar of beekeeping and board game design. My internal censor is alive and well, and not a few of these quatrains, even now rereading them for the nth time, tie a queasy knot in my stomach.</p>
            <p>But I must also admit that I know no other responsible party. The story of how I came by the manuscript is queer. In the early summer of 2022 I was wrapping up a sabbatical year spent in Portland, Oregon, a full day's drive from SIU's northern California campus. The weather had finally turned, and I set out to walk the sidewalks of one of the wealthier neighborhoods in that unfortunate city. This neighborhood is situated in a particularly hilly area, as if to ensure its defensibility in case of emergency. The very front yards loom four feet above the curb, held up by retaining walls, while the front doors of the (for west coast) antique houses sit atop yet another half flight of stairs. I ambled at a leisurely pace, enjoying the well-kept blossoming gardens and remarking to myself upon the myriad small markers of the recently reawakened civic religion. Then, as I neared the end of a block, I heard behind quick-paced footsteps, and stepped aside to let pass whatever peculiar denizen of the city overtook me.</p>
            <p>It was‚Äîa young woman jogging. In the first moment I glanced back I saw her lightly tanned oval face, hair pulled back from her brow, almond-shaped brown eyes, small coral lips pursed in a half-frown of aerobic exertion. Beauty there, though not exquisite. In the second, as she passed, I saw her figure, flesh well-toned, subtly curved, clad in jasper sports bra and seaweed lululemon leggings; and, as she nodded impersonal thanks for my step-aside, saw her bouncing chestnut ponytail, her long neck, and a small round white earring in her left ear. In the third long moment I watched her rhythmic steps down the block until she turned the corner and was lost to sight‚Äîand I watched the light occasionally catch her perhaps-pearl earrings. A floral scent lingered in her wake.</p>
            <p>I do not believe I would have remembered any of this but for the earrings, and for what happened next, which in some obscure way confirmed the earrings' significance. Even before I turned the corner after her I found myself wondering: What manner of woman thus exhibits herself on the sidewalk in form-fitting functionality, and yet wearing a relic of that time when bright gleam near bare throat could set the heart afire? Does she always wear pearls? Has she come newly from some setting more appropriate, and forgotten to doff them? Or will she soon go there, and will have no time to don them? Do pearl and lycra for her belong together, like linen suit and suede shoes? Well, I do not claim to know much of woman's mind. So I mused as I turned the corner, expecting her receding backside once more to bob into my view. But she was gone, and I heard her steps above my shoulder, and then a screen door open and swing shut.</p>
            <p>I turned to look up at the house that I supposed the earringed girl had entered: an ordinary two-story timber frame, of solid construction, painted a pale gold, with moon-white trim. My heart fell a millimeter on seeing both black-on-white and polychrome faith statements in the yard. I did not mark the intersection but I believe I could find it again if needed. Moderately surprising that a woman so young could afford it, but I refrained from drawing inferences.</p>
            <p>Beside the steps leading up to the house was a small box affixed to the retaining wall stenciled across with the words <span class="small-caps">Little Free Library</span>. However often such boxes disappoint I cannot resist them: once I found therein a volume of the poems of Herman Melville. That day, remarkably, I found two books: <span class="small-caps">Bronze Age Mindset</span>, by the eponymous Pervert, and <span class="small-caps">Kon-Tiki</span>, by Thor Heyerdahl. I took both, and continued on my walk. At my rental, in a neighborhood one rung down, I opened the latter. Ten pages shuffled out, having apparently been folded in sheaves of two and used to bookmark five separate passages.</p>
            <p>The sheets were torn from a moleskine notebook, written neatly across with a purple gel pen in a large looping hand, unmistakably female. The dots over the "i" and "j" had once been hearts, but the years had worn the writer down to hasty curlicues. It was easy enough to determine the order in which the pages went. The manuscript appeared to be a fair copy; there were, at any rate, only two emendations. I had no trouble reading and transcribing the words, though I cannot vouch for the punctuation. At a few points I felt compelled, on poetic grounds, to tidy up some of the clunkier lines.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, you will have to trust my transcription, for the manuscript is no longer in my possession. There were also about a dozen neon colored sticky notes in the book‚Äîmercifully, the previous owner was not a highlighter. One, on page 48 of Thor's book, contained the words: "trip to lima? 1. Whitewashed. 2. Macchu Pichu. 3. Summer = Winter." Another, on 193: "??? cf.&nbsp;#hbd thread on #samoans." Another, at bottom of 211: "where photo with BITCH wife? see <span class="small-caps">Kon-Tiki Man</span> 133." I forget the rest. These too, alas, have vanished, as have the volumes themselves. The year's end was over-hasty, our departure abrupt. On the last day I brought to the Portland Post Office several boxes of books and other papers to mail back home, and the relevant box was misdirected, one knows not where. (Shipping insurance, by the way, does not cover speculative losses.)</p>
            <p>Having given you the facts, I hesitate to invent explanations. The earringed jogging girl, I imagine that she wrote the poem, or knows who did; and the sticky notes too. But did she compose it? Or copy it out from some unknown source or sources? The poem is unsigned, and seems likely to remain so, unless the author reads this postscript (already three-fifths the word-count of its master) and comes forward. I do not know who has the moral right to authorize its publication, and in the absence of that knowledge I cannot but nominate myself, if not its author, then its underwriter.</p>
